# Data Analysis Experience

This repository contains a small handful of examples of my work from college.

(1) The first notebook exhibits my work as a research assistant from 2020-2021. This work started out in ArcGIS Pro, where I was already proficient, but quickly moved beyond pre-made software and into Python. Starting with a framework created step by step in Arc, I translated all of the processes into Python using Geopandas and SciPy so that the research team could move more quickly and scale up to the university supercomputer. In the end, I created an analysis process that created an environmental valuation for all 400,000+ parcels in Hennepin County, MN. I also focused heavily on the client side, ensuring that all of my work was documented, its place and importance diagrammed, and conveyed in a straightforward manner.

(2a) The second notebook continues my work as a research assistant as my team branched out from the Twin Cities metropolitan area into greater Minnesota - even Africa. The goal was to help the agricultural industry by systematizing the placement of climate sensors. These instruments have ISO-formulated criteria that must be met in order to ensure their data quality. I conducted deterministic spatial analyses to combine several data sources into one set of data that evaluated a piece of land for hosting a climate instrument.

(2b) While easy for the State of Minnesota, we wanted to analyze Malawi, in Africa, to show that this process was readily applicable. In this phase, I primarily focused on the data quality of the resources we had to work with. With my past experience, I was prepared to know what "felt right" when looking at the new analysis. The Malawi analysis was a success, and it was a gratifying feeling to know that I had just done complex geospatial analysis in Africa while sitting at my desk in Minneapolis.

For any questions about the above research, feel free to reach out to me at [dunst016@umn.edu](mailto:dunst016@umn.edu) or my former supervisor, Bryan Runck, at the [Agro Informatic Institute](https://agroinformatics.org/people/runck/) at the University of Minnesota.

(3) My third project shown here is an independent research project from a graduate-level transportation planning class. I chose to analyze the usage of e-scooters in Minneapolis through the lens of the "5 D's": density, diversity, design, distance to transit, and destination accessibility. Using City of Minneapolis data on more than 1,000,000 scooter trips, I made my data analysis processes faster, then analyzed the geospatial data to answer the question of how e-scooters are being used.

(4) Finally, I've included a copy of my senior capstone paper as an example of the qualitative research I have done. It looked critically at the American planning process and why the push for new bike infrastructure is running into obstacles in disadvantaged communities.
